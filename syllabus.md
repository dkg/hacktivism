## Note about this syllabus

The syllabus that is shared with this class is a living document. Please refer to the online version for up-to-date information. It will change and evolve throughout the semester: we have an off-the-shelf template to follow, but the finished version of this class is custom built for the group and our context as we go along.

## Course Description

This course explores the history, methods, ethos, and goals of hackers with special attention paid to their role in social movements. It broadly interprets the term “hacktivism” to include computer hacking, media hacking and “reality hacking” in the service of social change. Students will gain an understanding of how and why hackers have in recent years emerged as a major social force.

## Course objectives

Students who successfully complete this courses will be able to:

* Demonstrate an understanding of what hacking is, how it is perceived, and when it can be called “hactivism.”
* Recall fundamental knowledge about the history of hacking and how it developed as a cultural force.
* Analyze, discuss, and write about emergent hacking events.
* Perform their knowledge of legal forms of basic hacking.

## Assignments

There will be weekly reading and viewing assignments, as well as some writing assignments. Readings will be discussed in class. Readings will be provided as links to websites or digital downloads. The student’s knowledge of these readings will be reflected in the class participation grade.

## Attendance

Each class is important. As noted, much of each class will be devoted to in-class, hands-on work as well as lecture and discussion. Invariably, there will be things covered that cannot be made up outside of class. Attendance at classes and participation in discussions is mandatory, and grades will reflect this. More than four unexcused missed classes during the semester will lower a student's grade by one full letter grade.

## Grades

| CATEGORY                              | PERCENTAGE OF FINAL GRADE |
| --------------------------------------| -------------------------:|
| Class Participation / Presentations   |                       60% |
| Writing                               |                       40% |
| TOTAL                                 |                      100% |

*Percentage grade: 100-90=A, 89-80=B, 79-70=C, 69-60=D, below 60=F*

* To get an “A” you must do exceptional work.
* “B” is given for work that fulfills the requirements for the class.
* “C” grade is sufficient work, but is very average and not excelling in any way.
* “D” is poor work or incomplete work.
* “F” is a failing grade. Missing too many classes, or failing to submit 50% of assignments can result in a “F”.

## Policy on Academic Integrity

The RENSSELAER HANDBOOK defines various forms of Academic Dishonesty and procedures for responding to them. Students should familiarize themselves with this portion of the RENSSELAER HANDBOOK and should note that the penalties for plagiarism and other forms of cheating can be quite harsh. A grade of zero will be given on the first assignment where a violation is detected. If there is a subsequent infraction the student will receive a grade of F for the course. If you have any question concerning this policy before submitting an assignment, please ask for clarification.
